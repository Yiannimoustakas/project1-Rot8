## Project Description

This is my second project completed here at General Assembly. A similar time limit was given for this project. We had essentially Monday to Thursday to work on the project and present to the class on the Friday. The task at hand was to build a functional website project using rails. We have been learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails for the past two weeks, and this website will demonstrate all the skills we have covered within that time.

My idea was to create a Social Media Platform tailor made for sneakerheads and hypebeasts alike. Essentially the site will display a list of the hottest sneakers and brands to date. There are also what I have named as Rot8's, which are a list of 7 shoes, symbolizing the 7 days of the week, known in the industry as sneaker rotates... Users who sign up to the site will be able to build a Rot8 or many Rot8's for themseleves and display on the rotate wall. Users can then like or dislike the list and those lists will be ranked on the page from most heavily liked to heavily disliked. Anyone who rocks up to the link will be able to browse all of these pages. However those who sign up are able to add and edit their own shoes, create new Rot8 lists to add to the wall and like or dislike any Rot8 list on the site.

With the use of associated databases using ActiveRecord I would be able match associations between Brands, Sneakers, Rot8's, Users and User Likes and Dislikes.

## Known Bugs & Wishlist

No known bugs, I've had a lot of time to patch my site over the course of the week but I haven't had anyone play around on the site for long. A few things on my wishlist would be:
1. Patch UI on the Rot8 selection
2. Add admin capability for creating, editing and deleting sneakers and brands.
3. Add a rot8 feature button where only the featured Rot8's will show on the Rot8 wall.
